# AgWallBoard
A HTML and CSS based rough work board
Start by opening the "Ankan Wallboard" HTML file in a web browser.
You should see a green background with the title "Ankan Wallboard" at the top of the page and a canvas in the center of the page with a white background.
Use your mouse or touchscreen to draw on the canvas. You can click and drag to draw lines, shapes, or whatever you like.
If you want to start over, click the "Clear" button to clear the canvas.
If you want to save your drawing as an image, click the "Save" button. This will download the image file to your computer.
You can change the background image of the canvas by replacing the "background.jpg" file with another image file of your choice.
That's it! The drawing board interface is simple and easy to use. Have fun creating your own drawings and designs!
